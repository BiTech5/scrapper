# TechBehemoths Kathmandu Scraper

This project is a Python web scraper that collects company details from [TechBehemoths](https://techbehemoths.com/), specifically targeting companies listed in Kathmandu.  
The scraper gathers information such as:

- Company Name  
- Company Website  
- Company Number  
- Location  

All the collected data is exported into an Excel file (`company.xlsx`).

---

## How it Works

1. The script loops through multiple pages of Kathmandu company listings.  
2. For each company, it visits the detail page and extracts:  
   - Company name  
   - Website (if available)  
   - Contact number (if available)  
   - Location  
3. The data is stored in a structured dictionary.  
4. Finally, everything is combined into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as an Excel file.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository or copy the code.  
2. Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.8 recommended).  
3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas openpyxl
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
python scraper.py
```
## Output
After running, you will get an Excel file named:

company.xlsx
```

## Notes

Some companies may not have a website or contact number listed; in that case, the scraper adds placeholder text such as "Website is not mentioned" or "Number is not mentioned".

The script currently scrapes 3 pages of companies in Kathmandu. You can change this number inside the main() function.
